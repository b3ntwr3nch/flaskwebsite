    <section id="what-is-sdr">
        <h2>What is Software-Defined Radio?</h2>
        <p>Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components traditionally implemented in hardware are instead implemented in software. This approach provides great flexibility, allowing a single piece of hardware to serve multiple purposes and be easily upgraded.</p>

        <h2>HackRF One</h2>
        <p>HackRF One is a popular SDR platform capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. Developed by Great Scott Gadgets, it's an open-source hardware project that allows for both receiving and transmitting, making it versatile for various applications.</p>

        <h2>RTL-SDR</h2>
        <p>RTL-SDR refers to inexpensive USB dongles based on the RTL2832U chipset. Originally designed for DVB-T TV reception, these devices were found to be capable of raw data transfer, allowing them to function as cheap SDRs. They typically operate in the 24 MHz to 1766 MHz range, making them great for beginners in SDR.</p>

        <h2>Antennas for SDR</h2>
        <p>Antennas are crucial for SDR performance. Different types of antennas are suited for different frequencies and purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dipole Antennas: Simple and effective for a wide range of frequencies.</li>
            <li>Discone Antennas: Wideband antennas good for monitoring across large frequency ranges.</li>
            <li>Yagi Antennas: Directional antennas for focusing on specific signal sources.</li>
            <li>Loop Antennas: Good for lower frequencies and reducing noise in certain setups.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications and Experiments</h2>
        <p>With my SDR setup, I've explored various applications including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracking aircraft using ADS-B signals</li>
            <li>Decoding weather satellite images</li>
            <li>Analyzing GSM signals (for educational purposes only)</li>
            <li>Building a simple FM radio receiver</li>
        </ul>
