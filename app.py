    <p>The ROT13 cipher is a simple way to scramble text. Each letter in the text is replaced by the letter that is 13 places after it in the alphabet. Because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, doing this twice will get you back to the original text. It's often used as a basic way to hide text.</p>
    <p><b>How it Works:</b> Imagine the alphabet in a circle. For each letter in your text, move 13 steps forward. If you reach the end, continue from the start. For example, 'A' becomes 'N' and 'N' becomes 'A'.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b><br>
    - Original: "HELLO"<br>

    <p><b>How it Works:</b> Each character is translated into an 8-bit binary string (e.g., 'A' becomes '01000001'). Each '0' in the binary string is replaced with a sad emoji (ðŸ˜ž) and each '1' is replaced with a happy emoji (ðŸ˜„).</p>
